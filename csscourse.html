      CSS Solved a Big Problem

      HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
    
      HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
    
      h1>This is a heading/h1>
    
      p>This is a paragraph.p>
    
      When tags like font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
    
      To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
    
      CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
   
      What is an HTML Element?

      An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
      tagname> Content goes here... tagname>

      The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<!-- <h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>  -->

<pre style="display:inline;">
   <a href="index.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><<<</a>
   <a href="index.html" style="text-decoration: none;" >>>></a>
</pre>
